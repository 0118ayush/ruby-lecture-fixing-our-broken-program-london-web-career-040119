## Companion Lab

Fork and clone this repository and edit the files `lib/a_working_program.rb` and `spec/a_working_program_spec.rb` according to the instructions.

Your goal is to have a valid ruby program in `lib/a_working_program.rb`  and a corresponding test that the program is valid, that you expect it to not raise an error, in `spec/a_working_program_spec.rb`
